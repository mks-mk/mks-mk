# MOHAMMED SINAN MK

B.Tech Computer Science & Engineering (CSE ’25). 

Focused on building strong foundations in algorithms, systems programming, and computational optimization through implementation-driven learning.

---

## Current Focus

- Core mathematics and analytical problem solving  
- Preparing for Data Structures in C  
- Computer Organization & Architecture fundamentals  
- Writing logic-first code instead of relying on frameworks  

---

## Technical Skills

### Languages
- C (pointers, dynamic memory, file handling)  
- Python (basic scripting and algorithm implementation)

### Tools
- Git & GitHub  
- Linux CLI (basic usage)

### Core Concepts
- Genetic Algorithms  
- Function optimization  
- Basic time and space complexity analysis  

---

## Selected Projects

### Genetic Algorithm – Himmelblau Function Optimization

Implemented a real-valued Genetic Algorithm from scratch to locate global minima of a multimodal benchmark function.

- Designed selection, crossover (single-point, uniform), and mutation operators  
- Tuned mutation rate and population size  
- Tracked fitness convergence across generations  
- Analyzed exploration vs exploitation trade-offs  

**Key Learning:** Population-based stochastic search requires parameter tuning and diversity control to avoid premature convergence.

## What I’m Working Toward

By third year:
- Strong command of data structures and memory management in C  
- Clear understanding of CPU, memory hierarchy, and low-level system behavior  
- Writing efficient, well-structured code with measurable performance awareness  

Depth in fundamentals > surface-level tool familiarity.

## AI Usage Approach

AI is used as a learning and review assistant:

- Reviewing algorithm efficiency  
- Clarifying difficult concepts  
- Debugging logical errors  

All explanations are rewritten, tested, and validated manually.  
The goal is independent understanding.
